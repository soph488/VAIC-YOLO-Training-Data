Initiated by Team 11688A, this is a space for VAIC teams to share data used to train the depth camera based on the yolo model. 
By having multiple communities contribute to this dataset, everyone benefits by increased accuracy with more data to train the AI model.
We can break the limits of AI depth camera technology together.
